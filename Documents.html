  <h4 id="list-item-1"><b><i>Java</i></b></h4>
  <p>Java is a general-purpose computer-programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and
   specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application 
   developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support 
   Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any 
   Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular 
   programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. 
   Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) 
   and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax 
   from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>

  <h4 id="list-item-2"><b><i>Android</i></b></h4>
  <p>Android is a mobile operating system developed by Google, based on a modified version of the Linux kernel 
  and other open source software and designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. 
  In addition, Google has further developed Android TV for televisions, Android Auto for cars, and Android Wear for 
  wrist watches, each with a specialized user interface. Variants of Android are also used on game consoles, digital cameras,
  PCs and other electronics.</p>
  <p>Initially developed by Android Inc., which Google bought in 2005, Android was unveiled in 2007, with 
  the first commercial Android device launched in September 2008. The operating system has since gone through multiple major
   releases, with the current version being 8.1 "Oreo", released in December 2017.</p>

  <h4 id="list-item-3"><b><i>Sqlite</i></b></h4>
  <p>SQLite is a relational database management system contained in a C programming library. In contrast to many other database management systems, SQLite is not a clientâ€“server database engine. Rather, it is embedded into the end program.</p>
  <p>SQLite is ACID-compliant and implements most of the SQL standard, using a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the domain integrity.
SQLite is a popular choice as embedded database software for local/client storage in application software such as web browsers. It is arguably the most widely deployed database engine, as it is used today by several widespread browsers, operating systems, and embedded systems (such as mobile phones), among others. SQLite has bindings to many programming languages.</p>
